# simpleimagebrowser

## Abstract
Literally as simple as an image browser can get
it will ask the user which directory to look for
images from, and will display them, in the window.

Will also display some information about the image
and a thumbnail where appropriate


## Why
an exercise to understand the fyne-toolkit layouts
structs and file-handling
